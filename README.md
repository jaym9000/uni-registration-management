# University Registration Management System
This was a group collaborative project where we decided to build a University Registration Management System. 
Students will be able to see the courses they're registered for, tuition cost, calander and more. 
Professors will be able to see all students registered.

There is a GUIDE file along with a presentation that explains the project in more depth, feel free to read over them!

To run program: 
compile all .java files and then run main file. (login demo file is just to show a UI that can read input, this was a requirement for class).
